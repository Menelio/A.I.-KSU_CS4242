### Artificial Intelligence Assignments 

##  Assignment 1) 
Located in /JavaAIWorkSpace was to implement a performance-measuring environment simulator for the vacuum-cleanerworld. Your implementation should be modular so that the sensors, actuators, and environment characteristics (size, shape, dirt placement, etc.) can be changed easily.
  
##Assignment 2) Located in /JavaAIWorkSpace was to To implement A* Algorithm to solve the following problems: 
    
   **1)** 8 Puzzle Problem: The 8 puzzle consists of eight numbered, movable tiles set in a 3x3 frame. One cell of the frame is always empty thus making it possible to move an adjacent numbered tile into the empty cell. Start with a random state. The goal state is listed below.
  
  **2)** Path Finding Problem: Use A* Algorithm to find the shortest path through a weighted graph. 
  
##Assignment 3) Located in /C#AIWorkSpace to use Neural Networks to solve the following problems:
  
  **1)** Implement a perceptron to simulate the function for classifying an image with 2 x 2 pixels as shown in the PPT. Using 16 training examples.
  
  **2)** Implement the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) to recognize 4 blocks image to make a decision if an image is BRIGHT or DARK. Using the same 16 samples for the inputs from problem 1. You must have at least three layers in your ANN: input layer, hidden layer, and output layer.
