# Artificial Intelligence Assignments 

  **Assignment 1)** Located in /JavaAIWorkSpace was to implement a performance-measuring environment simulator for the vacuum-cleanerworld. Your implementation should be modular so that the sensors, actuators, and environment characteristics (size, shape, dirt placement, etc.) can be changed easily.
  
  
  **Assignment 2)** Located in /JavaAIWorkSpace was to To implement A* Algorithm to solve the following problems: 
    
  **1)** 8 Puzzle Problem: The 8 puzzle consists of eight numbered, movable tiles set in a 3x3 frame. One cell of the frame is always empty thus making it possible to move an adjacent numbered tile into the empty cell. Start with a random state. The goal state is listed below.
  
  **2)** Path Finding Problem: Use A* Algorithm to find the shortest path through a weighted graph.
